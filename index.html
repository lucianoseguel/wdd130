        <p>Hello! I´m Luciano Seguel, a web developer from Mendoza, Argentina. I love to solve problems
            since I was young I have always been fascinated by the world of computers and I started learning
            programming when I was 16 years old, making video games, in that moment I knew that programming was for me
